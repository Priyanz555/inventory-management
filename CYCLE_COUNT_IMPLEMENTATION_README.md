# Cycle Count Implementation - User Story 5

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of User Story 5: "As a distributor I should be able to do a cycle count to reconcile inventory so that the inventory visibility is in sync with actual levels in the warehouse."

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Inventory Structure
- **Multiple Quantity Heads**: Sellable, Allocated, Damaged, Expired, On-route quantities
- **Movement Tracking**: Sellable→Expired, Expired→Sellable, Sellable→Damaged, Damaged→Sellable
- **Reason Codes**: Required for specific inventory movements
- **MFG Date Management**: New MFG dates required for expired-related movements

### 2. Cycle Count Workflow
- **Initiation**: Explicit cycle count initiation with order processing blocking
- **Cancellation**: Ability to cancel with data loss and order processing restoration
- **Inventory Loading**: Load current inventory levels directly into UI grid
- **UI-Based Adjustments**: All inventory adjustments made directly through the interface
- **OTP Verification**: 6-digit OTP required before submission
- **Adjustment Documents**: Downloadable inventory adjustment reports

### 3. Advanced Validations
- All quantity heads must be ≥ 0
- Inventory movements must result in quantities ≥ 0
- Reason codes required for damage and expired movements
- MFG date changes required for expired movements
- OTP verification before submission

## Data Structure Changes

### Inventory Item Interface
```typescript
interface InventoryItem {
  skuId: string;
  description: string;
  dateAdded: string;
  mfgDate: string;
  baseUnit: 'CS' | 'EA';
  inventoryOnHand: number;
  sellableQty: number;
  allocatedQty: number;
  damagedQty: number;
  expiredQty: number;
  onRouteQty: number;
  sellableToExpired: number;
  expiredToSellable: number;
  sellableToDamaged: number;
  damagedToSellable: number;
  reasonCode?: string;
  newMfgDate?: string;
  hasError?: boolean;
  errorMessage?: string;
}
```

### Reason Codes
1. **WH Handling Damage** - Warehouse handling damage
2. **Inbound Transit Loss** - Loss during inbound transit
3. **Inbound Transit Shortage** - Shortage during inbound transit
4. **Market Return Damages** - Damages from market returns

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initiate Cycle Count
- User clicks "Initiate Cycle Count"
- System blocks order processing
- Session created with unique ID

### 2. Load Inventory Data
- User clicks "Load Inventory Data"
- System loads current inventory levels into UI grid
- All items available for direct adjustment

### 3. Make Adjustments
- User edits quantities directly in the grid
- Real-time validation of all fields
- Movement tracking validation
- Reason code validation

### 4. OTP Verification
- System sends 6-digit OTP to user's mobile
- User enters OTP in modal
- OTP validation before submission

### 5. Submit and Complete
- All validations pass
- Inventory adjustments processed
- Audit trail created
- Adjustment document generated
- Order processing restored

## Validation Rules

### Basic Validations
- All quantity heads must be ≥ 0
- Inventory on hand remains unchanged post-movement

### Movement Validations
- **Sellable→Expired**: Requires reason code and new MFG date
- **Expired→Sellable**: Requires new MFG date within expiry window
- **Sellable→Damaged**: Requires reason code
- **Damaged→Sellable**: Requires reason code

### Business Rules
- Movement quantities cannot exceed available quantities
- MFG dates for expired movements must be valid
- OTP must be 6 digits and valid

## Security Features

### OTP System
- 6-digit numeric OTP
- 10-minute expiration
- SMS delivery to registered mobile
- Server-side validation

### Session Management
- Unique session IDs
- Order processing blocking
- Audit trail for all actions

## UI/UX Improvements

### Enhanced Grid Interface
- 17-column inventory grid

- Color-coded error highlighting
- Inline editing capabilities
- Direct quantity adjustments

### Modal Dialogs
- OTP verification modal
- Confirmation dialogs
- Error message display

### Status Indicators
- Cycle count status indicator
- Order processing status
- Validation status per item

### Simplified Workflow
- No Excel file uploads required
- Direct UI-based adjustments
- Streamlined user experience

## Testing Considerations

### Mock Data
- Sample inventory items with movements
- Validation error examples
- OTP testing (123456 in development)

### API Testing
